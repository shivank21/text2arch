A simple web application architecture with a frontend that connects to a backend API, which then connects to a database.	digraph{
    rankdir=TB;
    node [shape=box];
    
    Frontend [label="Frontend"];
    Backend [label="Backend API"];
    Database [label="Database"];

}
A microservices architecture where a load balancer distributes requests to multiple service instances, each connecting to its own database.	digraph {
    rankdir=TB;
    node [shape=box];
    
    LoadBalancer [label="Load Balancer"];
    Service1 [label="Service 1"];
    Service2 [label="Service 2"];
    Service3 [label="Service 3"];
    DB1 [label="Database 1"];
    DB2 [label="Database 2"];
    DB3 [label="Database 3"];
    
    LoadBalancer -> Service1;
    LoadBalancer -> Service2;
    LoadBalancer -> Service3;
    Service1 -> DB1;
    Service2 -> DB2;
    Service3 -> DB3;
}
A data processing pipeline where data flows from a source system through a processing engine and then to a destination system.	digraph{
    rankdir=LR;
    node [shape=box];
    
    Source [label="Source System"];
    Processor [label="Processing Engine"];
    Destination [label="Destination System"];
    
    Source -> Processor [label="raw data"];
    Processor -> Destination [label="processed data"];
}
A message queue system where producers send messages to a queue, and consumers receive and process those messages.	digraph{
    rankdir=LR;
    node [shape=box];
    
    Producer1 [label="Producer 1"];
    Producer2 [label="Producer 2"];
    Queue [label="Message Queue"];
    Consumer1 [label="Consumer 1"];
    Consumer2 [label="Consumer 2"];
    
    Producer1 -> Queue [label="send"];
    Producer2 -> Queue [label="send"];
    Queue -> Consumer1 [label="receive"];
    Queue -> Consumer2 [label="receive"];
}
A user authentication system where users login through a web interface, the system validates credentials against a database, and returns a JWT token.	digraph G {
    rankdir=TB;
    node [shape=box];
    
    User [label="User"];
    WebInterface [label="Web Interface"];
    AuthService [label="Authentication Service"];
    Database [label="User Database"];
    TokenService [label="JWT Token Service"];
    
    User -> WebInterface [label="login request"];
    WebInterface -> AuthService [label="credentials"];
    AuthService -> Database [label="validate"];
    Database -> AuthService [label="user info"];
    AuthService -> TokenService [label="generate token"];
    TokenService -> AuthService [label="JWT token"];
    AuthService -> WebInterface [label="token response"];
    WebInterface -> User [label="authenticated"];
