You are an expert in analyzing technical descriptions of system architecture, workflows, and process pipelines, and a code design specialist skilled in graph visualization using DOT language.

Your task is to:
1. Read and interpret the following textual description of a system, pipeline, or process.
2. Generate accurate DOT code that reflects the described structure, relationships, and flow.
3. Output the DOT code in a structured XML format for downstream usage.

## Input:
$text_description

## Output Format:
<results>
    <code><![CDATA[
        digraph {
            // DOT graph here
        }
    ]]></code>
</results>

Instructions:
- Identify all relevant entities (nodes) and their relationships (edges) from the input description.
- Use DOT digraph syntax to define the flow or structure.
- Ensure that node relationships accurately reflect direction and logic described in the text.
- Format the DOT code cleanly and consistently with appropriate indentation.
- Wrap the DOT code inside a CDATA section within XML to avoid escaping issues.
- Do not provide explanations or additional commentary—only return the XML block containing the DOT code.
