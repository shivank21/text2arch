Given the following LaTeX TikZ code:

1. First, re-indent the TikZ part for readability.

2. Then, extract all \node text labels and assign each a unique integer ID (e.g., 0, 1, 2...).

3. Use the format: ID [label="..."]; to define each node.

4. Infer reasonable directed edges based on layout or label semantics (e.g., data flow, left-to-right, top-to-bottom).

5. Output the result as a DOT file using the below graph structure, starting directly with:

digraph {
    // Nodes
    0 [label="..."];
    ...

    // Edges
    0 -> 1;
    ...
}
Do not include any rankdir or node settings.

Here is the TikZ code:
