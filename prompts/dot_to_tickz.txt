You are an expert at converting Graphviz DOT (digraph/graph) definitions into LaTeX TikZ code.
Task: Convert the DOT code given as input into an equivalent TikZ (TikZ+graphdrawing or pure TikZ if graphdrawing not available) code block that can be compiled with LaTeX (produce a complete, standalone minimal LaTeX document).
Requirements (READ CAREFULLY, do not change these):
1. Preserve everything from the DOT input: node IDs, node labels (exact text), edge directions, edge connections, and the logical grouping/order. Do not modify labels, capitalization, punctuation, or node IDs.
2. Maintain the graph type (directed vs undirected) and edge arrowheads so the semantics remain identical.
3. Reproduce the structure/layout as closely as possible. If DOT includes rank or subgraph/cluster information, preserve it as TikZ comments and try to emulate grouping visually (e.g., using \n\t\t"subgraph" nodes or TikZ scopes).
4. Preserve node/edge attributes when possible (shape, style, color, fontsize). If an attribute has no direct TikZ equivalent, insert a commented line in the generated TikZ code that records the original DOT attribute (so nothing is lost).
5. Do NOT rewrite the diagram text, do not simplify or rename nodes, and do not reorder nodes/edges except where necessary for TikZ syntax. Any reordering must be mechanically necessary and the original ordering must be preserved in a commented block at the top.
6. The output must be ONLY the TikZ-containing LaTeX document — do NOT include the original DOT input, explanations, or any commentary. The output should compile with pdflatex (or lualatex/xelatex) without requiring external non-standard packages beyond TikZ and TikZ libraries commonly available (graphdrawing optional).
7. If the input DOT uses multiple disconnected graphs or multiple graph statements, produce separate TikZ pictures for each, clearly separated.
8. If the DOT uses numeric node IDs (e.g., 0, 1, 2) use those same IDs as node names in TikZ (prefix with N if necessary to make valid identifiers — but keep original IDs visible as labels).
9. For sequences of chained operations (e.g., CONV -> BN -> RELU -> CONV -> MaxPool), preserve the chain order and visually place them in a left-to-right or top-to-bottom sequence matching the DOT ordering.
10. If the DOT contains explicit ports, edge labels, or arrowheads, preserve them exactly as in the DOT (render edge labels as TikZ edge node labels).
11. If you encounter unsupported DOT constructs, do not drop them — include a commented section showing the original construct and an explanation (one line) of how it was mapped or why it could not be mapped precisely.
Formatting rules for the output file:
 Produce a minimal standalone LaTeX document that compiles (includes \documentclass{standalone} or article with preview, \usepackage{tikz}, and necessary \usetikzlibrary lines).
 - Wrap the actual drawing in a \begin{tikzpicture}...\end{tikzpicture} environment. If graphdrawing is used, include \usegdlibrary{force} or appropriate libraries and provide fallback coordinates if graphdrawing is unavailable.
 - Use comments ("% ...") to preserve the original DOT text at the top of the file. The original DOT must appear verbatim as a commented block so the conversion is traceable.
 - Keep the resulting TikZ code neat and indented.
 
 
 Input (DOT):
 <---BEGIN DOT--->
 {{DOT_INPUT}}
 ---END DOT---
 Output: Produce ONLY the complete LaTeX/TikZ source that implements the DOT graph above, nothing else. Do not add any extra text before or after the LaTeX code.
