You will be given a short, cleaned description of an image. Your task is to significantly increase the length of the description while preserving *exactly* the same information content. Do not add any new details, facts, interpretations, architectural components, domain-specific terms, or any information not explicitly stated in the original description.

You must only:
- Rephrase, elaborate, and expand the phrasing of what is already present.
- Use more descriptive language, redundant clarification, or extended explanations.
- Maintain the original meaning strictly.
- Avoid introducing any task-related details, instructions, or references to datasets, DOT code, models, or any processes outside of the original text.

The output should be a verbose, highly expanded paraphrase that conveys the same information with no new content.

INPUT:
$CLEANED_DESCRIPTION_HERE

OUTPUT:
$A significantly longer version that preserves all original meaning and adds no new information.
