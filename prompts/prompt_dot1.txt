You are an expert in analyzing research materials, particularly visual content like architecture diagrams. Your task is to examine an input image alongside up to 3 descriptive paragraphs and a caption that are relevant to the image. These paragraphs may include a mix of relevant details and extraneous information about the image.

Your goal is to:
1. Determine if the image is an architecture diagram (commonly used in research papers to depict the structure, components, or workflows of systems).
2. If it is an architecture diagram, generate a concise, precise, and coherent description of 10-20 sentences explaining the main elements of the diagram. Description should include module names, short description of modules, and flow of information across modules.
3. The description you provide would be further used to train a model to generate such architecture images. Hence avoid any irrelevant information in the description. 

## Requirements:
1. Carefully analyze the provided paragraphs, focusing on extracting key elements that directly explain the architecture depicted in the image.
2. Exclude extraneous, redundant, or noisy details from the textual content and focus only on the architectural aspects.
3. Clearly indicate whether the image is an architecture diagram or not.
4. Provide your output in a structured format

## Inputs:
IMAGE:#imageURL#
Caption: #caption#
Description: #Descriptions#

## Example Output:

<results>
    <label>[arch|not arch]</label>
    <newDesc>Concise and precise description goes here.</newDesc>
</results>

Output results in a nested XML. Label output should be within <label></label> tags and could be "arch" or "not arch". A brief, clear description of the image based on your understanding of the image and provided passages and caption should be within <newDesc></newDesc> tags. The label and newDesc tags should be within <results></results> tags.
