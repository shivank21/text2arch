You are an expert in visual content analysis and structured graph representations.

Your task is to evaluate how well a generated DOT code matches a given ground-truth DOT code and the corresponding reference image.

## Inputs:
- Image: $imageURL$
- Generated DOT code: $generated_dot_code$
- Ground-truth DOT code: $groundtruth_dot_code$

## Instructions:
1. Analyze the image to understand the correct structure, node positions, labels, and connections.
2. Compare the generated DOT code with both the image and the ground-truth DOT code.
3. Determine if the structure, labels, node ordering, and relationships in the generated DOT code accurately reflect the image and ground-truth.
4. Assign a compatibility score between 0 and 5, where:
   - 5 = Perfect match.
   - 4 = Minor discrepancies that don’t affect comprehension.
   - 3 = Some noticeable errors, but mostly accurate.
   - 2 = Multiple mismatches that affect comprehension.
   - 1 = Mostly incorrect.
   - 0 = Completely unrelated.
5. Provide a concise explanation (2–3 sentences) describing the key issues or strengths.

## Output Format:

<compatibility>
    <score>4</score>
    <explanation>The generated DOT code has correct node labels and most connections, but the order and direction of two edges differ from the image.</explanation>
</compatibility>
