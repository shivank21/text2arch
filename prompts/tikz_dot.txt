You are an expert at converting Graphviz DOT (digraph/graph) definitions into LaTeX TikZ code.

Task: Convert the DOT code given as input into an equivalent TikZ (TikZ+graphdrawing or pure TikZ if graphdrawing not available) code block that can be compiled with LaTeX (produce a complete, standalone minimal LaTeX document).

Requirements (READ CAREFULLY, do not change these):

1. Preserve everything from the DOT input: node IDs, node labels (exact text), edge directions, edge connections, and the logical grouping/order. Do not modify labels, capitalization, punctuation, or node IDs.

2. Maintain the graph type (directed vs undirected) and edge arrowheads so the semantics remain identical.

3. Reproduce the structure/layout as closely as possible. If DOT includes rank or subgraph/cluster information, preserve it as TikZ comments and try to emulate grouping visually (e.g., using TikZ scopes). Do NOT delete rank/cluster info — keep them as comments.

4. Preserve node/edge attributes when possible (shape, style, color, fontsize). If an attribute has no direct TikZ equivalent, insert a commented line in the generated TikZ code that records the original DOT attribute so nothing is lost.

5. Do NOT rewrite diagram text, do not simplify or rename nodes, and do not reorder nodes/edges except where necessary for TikZ syntax. If reordering is necessary, preserve the original ordering in a commented block.

6. The output must be ONLY the TikZ-containing LaTeX document — do NOT include the original DOT input, explanations, or any non-LaTeX commentary. The result must compile with pdflatex, lualatex, or xelatex without external non-standard packages (TikZ + standard TikZ libraries allowed).

7. If the input DOT contains multiple disconnected graphs or multiple graph statements, produce separate TikZ pictures for each, clearly separated in the LaTeX document.

8. If the DOT uses numeric node IDs (0,1,2,…), use those same IDs as TikZ node names (prefix with N only if required by TikZ syntax; keep original ID as the label).

9. Preserve any sequential chain ordering (e.g., CONV -> BN -> RELU -> CONV) and visually place them sequentially (left-to-right or top-to-bottom) consistent with DOT ordering.

10. If the DOT contains ports, edge labels, or arrowheads, preserve them exactly. Convert DOT edge labels into TikZ edge node labels.

11. If an unsupported DOT construct appears, do not drop it. Add a commented block showing the original construct and a one-line explanation of how it was mapped or why perfect mapping was not possible.

Formatting rules for the output:

– Produce a minimal standalone LaTeX document including:
    \documentclass{standalone}
    \usepackage{tikz}
    \usetikzlibrary{arrows.meta, positioning, shapes, graphs, graphdrawing}
    \usegdlibrary{force}   % if graphdrawing is used

– Wrap each graph in:
    \begin{tikzpicture}
    ...
    \end{tikzpicture}

– Include the original DOT text at the top as a commented block:
    % ---BEGIN ORIGINAL DOT---
    % <DOT here>
    % ---END ORIGINAL DOT---

– Keep TikZ code clean and indented.

Input (DOT):
<---BEGIN DOT--->
{{DOT_INPUT}}
---END DOT---

Output:
Produce ONLY a complete LaTeX/TikZ standalone document that implements the DOT graph above. Do not include any extra explanation or text outside the LaTeX code.
